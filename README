Bash functions and customizations that I've found useful and need everywhere I
do work in the shell.

Git Status in the Bash Prompt
========================================

  This is based off of the example from gitready.com:
  
    http://henrik.nyh.se/2008/12/git-dirty-prompt
  
  I keep my $HOME directories checked in to their own Git repository, with a
  branch named `home'.  I've added a check to the above so the prompt shows not
  just which branch, but a `[---]' when I'm in a directory not tracked by the
  current git repository.
  
  Eg, in a clean $HOME:
  
    kburton@kburton-lin ~[home]$
  
  in a dirty $HOME:
  
    kburton@kburton-lin ~[home*]$
  
  in my ~/tmp directory (untracked):
  
    mortis@kburton-lin ~/tmp[---]$
  
  in a clean sub (git) project directory (branch is master):
  
    mortis@kburton-lin ~/projects/krb-bash-utils[master]$
